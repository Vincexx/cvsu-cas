FACULTY DEVELOPMENT                                Faculty  Development  aims  to  improve  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  the                         individual faculty members relevant to their academic roles. It consists of a broad-                         range of activities designed to improve teaching effectiveness and efficiency which                          ultimately helps in the attainment of the vision and mission of the University.                                An  academic  institution  or  curriculum  offering  is  greatly  measured  by  the                         credentials of  its faculty members. In this light, the faculty should be composed of                         competent members in terms of academic qualifications, experience and professional                         expertise.  In addition, they should manifest desired personal qualities and high level                          of professionalism.                                To be effective, faculty members should be properly compensated and taken                         care of. They must be given opportunities for continuous personal and professional                         growth  and  development.  A  policy  of  fair  and  equitable  distribution  of  teaching                         assignments and workload should be adopted by the institution.                                Cavite State University has a  well-funded Faculty Development Program. It                         aims to improve the attitude, skills and knowledge of the individual faculty members.                          The  program  includes  criteria  for  the  selection  of  scholars/grantees,  and                         opportunities/study privileges, as well as research grants, training, and the like that                         are  available.  Faculty  members  are  encouraged  to  join  relevant  professional                         organizations and to continuously upgrade their knowledge and skills.                                The faculty development of the College of Arts and Sciences is governed by                          the University Development Plan (2012-2020) of the Human Resource Development                         Office.

On  the  college  level,  budgetary  support  from  the  College  general  fund  is                         provided  as  shown  in  the  table.  Attendance  to  seminars  and  conventions,  study                         tours,  team  building  and  other  related  activities  are  allocated  with  budget  by  the                         college.

PROVISION OF MATERIALS AND OTHER RESOURCES                 The manpower of the College of Arts and Sciences is very strong. It has an adequate pool of                 highly competent and qualified faculty handling professional and general education courses.                 Majority of the faculty members teaching major courses if not holders of master’s degrees,                 are currently pursuing higher learning. Certain psychology subjects have adopted manuals                 for instruction such as that of Limpingco and Tria (2002) wherein self-made activities were                  injected for regular utilization.  Further,  psychology instructors are already in the process of                 designing modules for instruction this academic year 2020-2021.                         In terms of other resources, the University gives provision of honoraria, grants and                 incentives for additional services and awards that conform to usual auditing and accounting                 procedures.                         On the other hand, FSDP provides scholarships to faculty members who wanted to                  continuously upgrade their professional qualifications. The table below shows the names of                 the  faculty  members  who  qualified  as  scholars  and  were  able  to  receive  the  following                 provisions:                                                                                                                282","Table 4.9.
