               approved BOR Resolution No. 57, series of 2001, the offering of the program began in the academic


               year 2002-2003 with around 90 enrollees. The program can be taken as a regular four (4) – year

               course offering. First 35 graduates under the program acquired their degree in 2006.

                      The Bachelor of Science in Psychology was offered in Cavite State University as result of

               the career and information service given by the Office of Student Affairs to different high schools in

               Cavite. The interest of high schoolers was evident on the school-to-school survey and campaign


               given by the guidance counselors. Further feasibility studies, in coordination with the high school

               guidance counselors, strengthen the need to offer BS Psychology in CvSU, particularly in the main

               campus.

                      The  first  Psychology  Program  Coordinator  was Ms.  Joy G.  Novero,  designated  in  2010.

               Under her supervision, the first revision of the curriculum was approved on March 2010, with BOR

               Resolution No. 110 dated March 10, 2010. The second revision was approved on June 21, 2016

               with BOR Resolution No. 33, series of 2016, abiding by CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) 38,


               series of 2010. Ms. Novero was succeeded by the current Psychology Program Coordinator, Ms.

               Armi Grace B. Desingaño, in 2017. The BS Psychology curriculum was further monitored, reviewed,

               and revised by the DSSH curriculum review committee in accordance with the policies and minimum

               standard requirements of CMO No. 34, series of 2017 (Policies and Standards for Undergraduate

               Programs  in  Psychology);  CMO  No.  20,  series  2013  (General  Education  Curriculum:  Holistic


               Understandings, Intellectual and Civic Competencies) ; and CMO 4, series 2018 (Policy on the

               Offering of Filipino and Panitikan Subjects in all Higher Education Programs as Part of the New

               General Education Curriculum). It was subsequently presented and endorsed by the CAS academic

               council and CvSU university council to the Board of Regents for approval.

                      In  pursuant  of  continuously  upgrading  the  quality  of  BS  Psychology  program,  it  was

                      Another means of ensuring quality of instruction is through constant review and revision of

               the  BS  Psychology  curriculum.  This  needed  enhancement  in  the  curriculum  is  based  from

               recommendations solicited during consultative meetings with different stakeholders, and as result

               of conducted tracer studies. The review and revision of the curriculum was one of the major findings

               in  the  study  of  Canaynay  (2009)  as  a  way to  ensure  efficacy  of the  curriculum.  As  suggested,


               relevant  major  subjects  are  added  –  including  the  use  of  CHED  compliant  course  titles,  minor

               subjects are changed according to what is befitting the senior high school graduates, number of

               hours allotted for practicum is increased, and proper organization/order of major and minor subjects


                                                                                                              8]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[is carefully considered. Aside from this, the study of Espiritu, Loyola and Talisic (2015), and Centino,

               Juan and Lavador (2015) allowed the core faculty to gain data about the relevance of the graduates’

               curriculum  to  their  job  performance  and the  prevalence  of  career mismatch  among  Psychology

               graduates.  This gave the core faculty initiative to hone the students into various specializations that


               can really prepare them in the world of work, including educational, clinical and industrial field. On

               the  other  hand,  the  results  from  the  study  of  Atuel,  Magat  and  Parugao  (2017);  Mercader  and

               Sucanel (2017); Basa, Nuestro and Peji (2018); and Ampuyas, Alvisor and Morie (2018) became

               bases for non-academic attributes, values and characteristics of students to be highlighted and take

               part in the curriculum. Their results gave birth to the inclusion of courses such as Personal-Social


               Development and Career Development on previous curriculums.

                      More recently, the revision of curriculum revolved on ensuring competitiveness of graduates

               in taking the Board Licensure Examination for Psychometricians (BLEP). Through various research

               results, review and revision of the curriculum gave way for innovations such as the administration

               of qualifying examination (Abejuela, Inocencio & Paras, 2018); improvement of teaching strategies

               and  alignment  of  syllabi  content  to  Professional  Regulation  Commission’s  BLEP  table  of

               specifications  (Desingano,  de  Ocampo  &  Barangan,  2017);  and  the  offering  of  Competency


               Appraisal 1 and 2 courses (Hernandez, Licmuan & Medina, 2019).

                      The existing curriculum was revised in accordance with the provisions of CMO No. 34, series

               of 2017 (Policies and Standards for Undergraduate Programs in Psychology); CMO No. 20, series

               2013  (General  Education  Curriculum:  Holistic  Understandings,  Intellectual  and  Civic

               Competencies); and CMO 4, series 2018 (Policy on the Offering of Filipino and Panitikan Subjects

               alternative methods for students and teachers to continue with their lessons when the traditional

               face-to-face classes is a risk to safety. The BS Psychology Program faculty members revised the

               syllabi for each course to integrate distance learning which enables students to have more agency


               over their learning and be more engaged. Further, the development of online instructional materials,

               learning guide for each course and a modular approach aims to deliver alternative, but still quality

               learning methods for students who have varying opportunities. This way, the CvSU BS Psychology

               Program continues to provide students with quality education despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

                      This constantly increasing trend, including the overall rate surpassing the national rate, is a


               good evidence that the efforts to ensure quality instruction is effective.

                      Aside from faculty members, students are also encouraged to acquire additional information

               and experience through attendance to extra-curricular activities. Included in the course syllabi are

               student activities such as symposia, seminars, workshop, professional lectures, exhibits, community

               immersion,  institutional  visits,  and  extension  activities.  These  extra-curricular  activities  allow

               students to explore and have experiential learning outside the classroom, enabling them to get a


               grasp of real-life setting.

               events also give them chance to interact and learn more from experts, which allows them to discover

                      Information gathered through these events also give the students concepts that they can

               responsibilities and goals.

               choosing a suitable career for them. Spending time joining seminars, trainings, and workshops is

               also form of personal development, which is one of the things that employers usually look for, since

               it could highlight activities that students have been involved.

               enough to be honed not only within the bounds of the classroom, but also on real-life scenarios.


               This practical application of things learned in trainings and seminars was found to positively correlate

               the job performance of Psychology graduates (Centino, Juan & Lavador, 2015). Thus, the ability of

               the graduates to be employed and to maintain employment, as shown on table below, could be

               attributed to their attendance on non-academic activities.

                      All BS Psychology students are required to prepare and conduct an undergraduate thesis to

               apply the theories learned before they are allowed to graduate. Student researches are directed

               along the major fields of industrial, clinical, educational psychology. At the same time most research


               explored individual and community counseling, Gender and Development (LGBTQI++), Geriatrics,

               Drug and Recovery, Interpersonal Relationship, and mental health . Also, the researches steered

               by the psychology students are aligned and anchored with the university and the college research

               agenda.

                      The University has five research thematic areas namely Agri-fisheries and Food security,


               Biodiversity  and  Environmental  Conservation,  Smart  engineering,  ICT,  and  Industrial

               Competitiveness, Societal Development and Equality, and Public Health. On the other hand, the

               College of Arts and Sciences’ Research and Extension Framework or CAS CARES (2018-2022)

               focuses on the three key areas which include the CAS BEE (focus on the researches related to bee

               keeping);  CAS  Coffee  (focuses  on  the  researches  related  to  coffee,  coffee  production,  and

               marketing); and CAS HELPS (focuses on the local and international research and development

               thrusts  to  which  the  extension  projects  are  all  aligned.  The  four    departments’  research  and


               extension (R and E) projects are all anchored on the College’s R and E Framework, but most of the

               Department of Social Sciences and Humanities’ especially the Psychology program, based the R

               and E endeavors on the Social Organization Through Comprehensive Services and Community

               Intervention (SOCSCI).

                      Psychology  students  mainly  operated  their  research  works  on  the  areas  of  Societal


               Development  and  Equality,  and  the  CAS  HELPS.  The  Societal  Development  and  Equality

               thematic  area  aims  to  create  social  inclusive  growth  and  development,  social  harmony,  equal

               opportunities among the different social groups and to lessen economic division, inequality  and

               marginalization in the society. This thematic area focuses on educational, criminological and social

               science  researches  and  development  initiatives  with  emphasis  on  sustainable  development,

               analysis of societal problems scientifically and provision of comprehensive community services in

               promoting socio-political and psycho-cultural development to improve the quality of life of intended


               partners through sustainable research and extension projects, to strengthen external linkages, and

               to advocate gender and development. Likewise, the psychology research works are anchored on

               the diverse university and college’s research framework and agenda.

                      The BS Psychology researches are now evolving in the sense that they now gear toward

               using  different  research  designs  and  methodologies.  Most  of  the  current  researches  followed


               Qualitative Research Designs and Methods to provide a different perspective from the quantitative

               analysis of the various phenomena. To support this, the program outlined activities to enrich the

               faculty and students' capability in doing qualitative researches through conducting and attending

               seminars and workshops in doing qualitative researches for social sciences.

                      The undergraduate thesis is the main research undertaking of BS Psychology students. The

               conduct of their thesis is supervised by the advisory committee following the approved outline and

               the  approved  Cavite  State  University  form  and  style.  The  students  undergo  proposal  and  final


               defense. After the proposal defense, the approved titles are submitted by the Department Research

               Coordinator to the Ethics Review Board. The Board screens the studies and provided additional

               instructions  when  the  studies  will  undergo  further  evaluation  or  not.  A  certificate  as  a  proof  of

               clearance  from  the  ERB  will  then  be  released.  The  students  may  now  proceed  with  the  data

               collection.  After  the  conduct  of  their  thesis,  the  students  work  on  their  manuscript  under  the


               supervision of their thesis advisers and technical critics. Other experts such as statisticians, test

               validators,  and  coders,  work  hand  in  hand  to  provide  a  dynamic  analysis  of  the  research.  The

               students defend the results of the study to the panel of evaluators which usually include faculty

               members,  department  chairperson,  department  research  coordinator,  and  the  college  research

               coordinator.

                      Suggestions,  comments,  and  recommendations  are  noted  and  incorporated  upon  the

               revision of their manuscript.

                      The  Extension  Program/Agenda/Activities  of  the  Department  of  Social  Sciences  and

               Humanities are based on the University’s thrusts and agenda. The needs, problems, and resources

               of the clients and the community were assessed before the extension program(s) were designed


               and implemented.

                      The extension program of the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology was anchored upon the college

               extension project, CAS KK: Community Adoption Services Kabarangay and Kaeskwela Project. The

               project  aims  to  enhance  positive  value  reorientation  that  will  bring  about    increased  youth’s

               competence level in Basic Math, Language, Arts and Environmental concern; increased family’s


               livelihood  opportunities  for  increased  family  income;  increase  in  local  governance’s  level  of

               leadership  in  community  development  activities;  and  elevation  of  client  system  from  program

               recipients to program partners in community development.

               Harmony: Handling Marital Conflicts make it easy) program is one of the activities that demonstrates

               the applications of the services and courses covered in the Bachelor of Science in Psychology. It

               aims to enhance positive value reorientation. Through this coordination, homepartners were able to


               identify physical, mental, emotional differences between husband and wife; discuss how couple

               differences may be used in activities for community development, to promote couple power towards

               participation among residents of IHGPV, Daine II, Indang, Cavite; and appreciate varied roles of

               husband and wife in building strong family and community ties.

                      The successfulness and positive feedback from the extension program of BS Psychology in


               Indang Habitat Gangneung Pine Village in Barangay Daine 2, Indang, Cavite has brought about the

               commencement of another extension project on the college in Mendez, Cavite: CAS CARES, CAS

               hastened to respond by enforcing measures such as social-distancing, quarantine, and isolation.

               While necessary, these measures can have a significant effect on people’s mental health.  For this

               reason, the BS Psychology students and teachers responded to the need of the community by


               helping  people  to  cope with  the  various  impacts  brought  by the coronavirus  disease  in  form  of

               interactive webinars. Supplemental to the application of concepts and theories in Psychology, as

               well as fulfilment of course requirements, these events provided the community, especially young

               people, with a platform for genuine connection amid uncertainty, encouraging them to field their

               questions to mental health professionals as well as generate mental health awareness.

                       In 2017, Psychology Program Faculty Members joined the Lakbay-Aral and Benchmarking

               of the BS Psychology Program at St. Louis University, Baguio City. This Benchmarking opportunity

               has improved the quality of the CvSU BS Psychology Program and consequently enhanced the

               competencies of BS Psychology students, which reflected in improvement of passing rate in the

               Board Licensure Exam for Psychologists and Psychometricians (BLEPP) in 2018, wherein the CvSU


               Passing Rate of 55.9% has surpassed the National Passing Percentage of 47.73%

                      1.3.1 Curriculum Revision

                      Cavite  State  University-Main  Campus  had  been  offering  BS  Psychology  program  since

               2002. Prior to being a Level II AACUP accredited program, its curriculum was revised a number of


               times  to  ensure  global  competitiveness  of  its  growing  student  clientele.  Commission  on  Higher

               Education (CHED) was the last to mandate the revision of the curriculum on 2015, as the program

               sought  recognition  and  accreditation.  The  curriculum  revision  was  headed  by  Cavite  State

               University-Imus Campus, wherein the revised curriculum was implemented August 2016.

                      With  the  implementation  of  the  K-12  Basic  Education  Curriculum,  higher  education


               institutions are advised to align its curriculum as mandated by the Commission on Higher Education.

               CHED memo no. 34, series of 2017 subjects the Psychology program with an urgent need to again

               review  and  revise  its  undergraduate  program,  under  the  Department  of  Social  Sciences  and

               Humanities, College of Arts and Sciences.

                      In order to provide equitable and relevant educational opportunities to its graduates, the

               Psychology program primarily held the Psychology Curriculum Revision with the core faculty on July

               24, 2017, attended by the campus program coordinators, college dean, department chairpersons,


               faculty members and other key personnel. On August 24, 2017, curriculum review was again held

               together with the stakeholders, participated by parents, students, alumni, government personnel,

               and  linkage  partners.  The  revised  curriculum  proposal  was  reviewed  by  the  college  academic

               council on October 26, 2017, and the council of deans with the vice president for academic affairs

               on April 10, 2018. The proposal was submitted to CHED Regional and Central Office for review and


               approval of the university board of regents.

                      The proposed revision is hereby foreseen to attune with the demands of senior high school

               graduates as incoming college students. It is also viewed as an opportunity to maximize student-

               learning  in  preparation  for  psychometrician  board  examination,  as  stipulated  by  RA  10029.

               Strengthening student competency on board subjects (Psychological Assessment-40%; Theories of

               Personality-20%; Abnormal Psychology-20%; and Industrial Psychology-20%), as indicated in the

                      The members of the curriculum review and development committee unanimously agreed to

               add 12 units from the mandated minimum number of units based from CMO 34, series of 2017. The

               additional  courses  are  inclusive  of  one  General  Education  Course  (Retorika/Masining  na

               Pagpapahayag- 3 units), one Psychology Elective Course (Introduction to Counseling-3 units), two

               Institutional Mandated Courses for Board Programs (Competency Appraisal 1 and Competency

               Appraisal 2). These additional courses are seen as vital in ensuring that the curriculum upholds


               quality instruction that can produce globally competitive graduates.

                      As part of compliance to BS Psychology CMO, the program also takes sufficient steps in

               abiding by the recommendations given by CHED during RQAT visit. These recommendations were

               greatly  considered  during  curriculum  revision.  Compliance  report  was  also  submitted  to  CHED

               reflecting the program’s aggressive pursuit to attain COPC.

                      The course analyses are regularly updated in order to enhance the delivery of the subject

               matter. This task requires, among others, the inclusion of new topics and deletion of topics that are

               already outdated in consonance with approved curriculum development and revision.


               1.3.3 Classroom Management

                      The College implements different classroom management strategies. At the beginning of

               every  semester,  instructors  are  required  to  discuss  their  respective  classroom  policies  and

               management in the class. These policies are also included in the syllabi which are distributed to the

               students.


                      Records  of  students’  daily  attendance  are  filed  and  used  for  monitoring  and

               guidance/counseling  purposes.  Regular  class  attendance  is  done  through  roll  calls  and  signed

               attendance sheets. Students are also informed regarding the University policy on class attendance

               through student orientations and inclusion in the Student Handbook.

                      Lecture  and  laboratory  classes  are  provided  with  appropriate  floor  spaces  and  facilities

               necessary to the learning of the students.

                      Discipline  inside  the  classroom  is  also  strictly  implemented.  The  students  are  also


               encouraged to help maintain the cleanliness of classrooms and other facilities of the school.

               1.3.4 Development and Production of Instructional Materials

                      Part of the performance commitment of faculty members is to produce modules, learning

               guides and laboratory manuals. The University maintains a University Textbook and Publications

               Board for the publication of various instructional materials. Additional books, journals, and reference


               materials are periodically acquired by the University in order to increase its present book collections,

               journals, and reference material holdings in hard and soft copies. Table 1.14 shows the list of the

               instructional materials developed by faculty members for the last five years.

               1.3.9 Administrative Support for Effective Instruction

                      The Board of Regents is the highest authority in the University. The University President

               serves as the Vice Chairman of the Board and is supported by five vice Presidents: VP for Academic

               Affairs, VP for Research and Extension, VP for Administrative and Support Services, VP for External

               and Business Affairs, and VP for Planning and Development.

                      As part of administrative support for effective instruction, particularly in establishing linkage


               partners such as on-the-job training sites, the university created the Office of International and Local

               Collaboration and Linkages under the Office of the President. Part of the function of this office is to

               regulate  quality  assurance  in  joining  international  education  network  and  forge  partnership  with

               highly acclaimed international HEIs.

               for Academic Affairs, followed by the College Dean and the Department Chairperson. All activities

               related to instruction follow the hierarchy of the Organizational Structure for Instruction.

                      To ensure effective instruction, faculty performance evaluation is periodically conducted. The


               institution implements rules on the attendance of the faculty members. Upon entry, the University

               implements the biometric system in checking the attendance and a faculty checker is assigned to

               monitor the attendance of the teachers in the classroom.

                      At the beginning of each semester, all faculty members are required to submit a syllabus for

               each  subject  handled  and  must  be  duly  approved  by  the  appropriate  superior.  Submission  of


               midterm  and  final  examinations  including  the  table  of  specifications  are  also  required.  The

               department chairperson conducts supervisory visits of classes and holds a regular faculty meeting

               to ensure proper conduct of classes.

                      The  University  also  has  a  strong  Faculty  Development  Program  to  encourage  those

               deserving faculty members to pursue advance studies in their fields of specialization.

                      It also implements a system of awards in recognition of the outstanding achievements of the

               faculty  members.  Students  with  exemplary  skills  in  academics,  sports,  music,  and  arts,  are


               encouraged  to  apply  for  the  different  scholarships  offered  by  the  University.  Faculty  members,

               employees, and students are recognized during the annual celebration of the University and College

               Foundation Days.

                      Besides,  CvSU  gives  a  variety  of  incentives  for  all  well-performing  employees  of  the

               institution  such  as cash  gifts for  employee  awardees,  overload  pay  for every  semester, annual

               clear memorandum of understanding/agreement with linkage partners. The college, through the

               OJT coordinators, carefully screen and accredit partner agencies in accordance to the standards

               set by the CMO and Psychological Association of the Philippines. Specifically, OJT coordinators set


               requirements in order to recognize if the agency to which the students wish to have their internship

               meets the standard in ensuring effective instruction.

                      For  educational  setting,  the  linkage  partner  (school)  should  at  least  have  a  registered

               guidance  counselor  who  could  serve  as  the  immediate  supervisor  of  the  intern.  A  registered

               psychometrician    or   an   equivalent   HR     supervisor   with   specialization   in   human


               resources/organizational development should be present to supervise the intern’s OJT in industrial

               setting. On the other hand, a registered psychologist is expected to train an intern in clinical setting.

                      As part of accrediting procedure, the linkage partner is expected to enumerate a set of job

               description for the trainee that is relevant to her field of specialization. After ensuring the above

               qualifications, part of the procedure are OJT documents that need to be accomplished such as the

               letter  of  intent,  letter  of  introduction/endorsement,  job  description  form,  parent’s  waiver,  and

               MOU/MOA.


                      The university also provides a manual (Narrative Report Writing Manual for OJT) for students

               in order to guide them on their internship journey. This clearly states the expectations from the

               different agencies and stakeholders involved in the goal of the students to gain relevant training.

               of graduation and a university clearance before diploma and transcript of records are released. The

               students must be cleared  from academic and financial accountabilities before they graduate.

               1.3.11. Employment of Graduates

                           Based on a study conducted in 2015 by Christine Joy G. Carandang, Rassil J. Goboleo,

               and Cazielyn U. Mendoza, titled “Work Settings, Problems Encountered, and Adjustment Level of


               Psychology Graduates from Batch 2012-2013”, it was revealed that majority of the BS Psychology

               graduates worked in industrial setting, some were part of the BPO industries, while few were in

               educational  setting  as  teachers  or  guidance  facilitators.  There  were  240  graduates  from  the

               mentioned batches who participated in the study. From these two batches, none was in the clinical

               field.  They  did  not  experience  problems  with  regards  to  the  benefits  that  they  received,  work

               environment, and company policies. Graduates were found to have a high level of adjustment.

                      Another tracer study conducted in 2016 by Generose M. Cabalbag, Ruth Jezerene G. Dela


               Peña, and Ma, Therese Bianca S. Nuestro,     titled “Proficiency and Applicability  of Competency

               Skills of BS Psychology Graduates Batch 2014: Basis for Curriculum Enhancement Program”, it

                                                                                                            160]]></page><page Index="177"><![CDATA[was revealed that among 120 participants, few of them obtained Master’s Degree and worked as

               Human Resources Personnel. The graduates had a high proficiency and applicability levels, which

               meant that they excelled more in technical competencies such as human resources development

               and management tasks, IT/technological tasks, and Interpersonal competencies,  that are relevant


               in their current work. They were proficient and excellent with their current work since the curriculum

               provided them adequate training and preparation for their future work. Moreso, it was recommended

               to extend or provide additional practicum hours, from the previous 240 hours basically covering

               industrial  and  clinical  settings,  additional  120  hours  be  rendered  for  the  educational  setting.

               Additional extra-curricular activities, and elective subjects were highly recommended.


                      In 2015, a study titled Predictors of Job Performance of 2011-2012 Graduates in the BS

               Psychology Program at CvSU Don Severino De Las Alas Campus, by Hershey V. Catajan, Carrie

               Ann C. David, and April B. Manaog, it was revealed that the graduates exhibited high level of job

               competency. Identified competencies described as  in “expert level”  vary from working as a team,

               planning, integrity and work standards. They were highly motivated, highly reliable, and can easily

               adapt to their working environments. They were knowledgeable, have an initiative and dependable.

               It was concluded that predictor of job performance is the job competency. Those skills mentioned


               were essential on how the graduates fulfill their tasks in the organization.

                      Based from the results of the study titled Job Competency, Satisfaction and Performance Of

               Graduates  in  the  Psychology  Program  from  Batch  -2008-2010  by  Lilibeth  Enopia,  Armae

               Pagkaliwangan, and Norbeliza Vergara, it was revealed that the level of competency was proficient

               for they could immediately see what is happening and can provide concrete decisions on how to


               approach the situation. Results revelead that they were uncertain whether they were really satisfied

               with their duties and responsibilities. The job performance were all in the very satisfactory level.


                      The finding also revealed that job satisfaction was not influenced by the level of their job

               competency. On the other hand, job competency influenced their job performance. It was found to

               be a predictor of job performance of their graduate. This was similar to the results of the more recent

               conducted research.


                                                                                                            161]]></page><page Index="178"><![CDATA[According to the placement officer of the College, majority of the graduates from 2015 to
